    "about_description": "I am someone who likes to be curious – take a new course, learn a new sport, play a new instrument. For some reason it doesn’t stop there; it needs to be as weird as possible. If I have heard of something, or know someone else has it, I become uninterested. From the purple jackets I wear, to the songs I listen to, to the software I like to make; It all needs to be exciting, unique, and done the right way, otherwise why bother. I am an avid pianist, traveler, kiteboarder, SCUBA diver, backcountry alpine skier, mountain climber, and anything else I can get my hands on. I speak Spanish for the most part – mainly to find new food to try. I love new things, but still somehow love coming back to my routine, my home, my friends, and my family.\n\nI don’t believe that my intelligence or talent have been instrumental bringing me to where I am today. For me, it’s my curiosity that compels me to push forward. While I may have the ability to do the research and write a thorough paper on Stalinism, my curiosity implores me to do something a bit more captivating. No offence meant toward anyone who has spent their life on Stalinism, but personally, I would rather rake cut grass into three perfect piles. In recent time, software engineers are no longer scarce, but anyone can build a website. My need for an answer forces me to be more inventive and have more fun. Given the time, curiosity will create something far more interesting than raw skill (not that I’m completely lacking in that area). This page is the perfect example of my point. While yes, I could have made the same personal site that everyone does, I find that boring and uninteresting. Quite frankly, I don’t think I could even finish one – I would probably end up fading away into something a bit more exciting, like lunch.",

    "project_1_description": "The kite calculator is a passion project of mine. I am an avid kiteboarder, windsurfer, and sailor. Where kiteboarding and windsurfing differ from sailing, is that depending on the wind, sailors can raise or lower their sail, changing the amount of surface area so they are never overpowered. Kites and windsurfers come in one size that cannot be changed, so you will need to buy another of a different size to sail in different weather. Given the unexpected nature of weather, in order to kite or windsurf anywhere regularly, you will need at least 2 or three sizes. This uncertainty is where this site comes into use. Given the rider’s weight and the current wind speed, it can give you a recommended kite size in m2. In the future, I would like to expand this to include windsurfing, kite foiling, and wing foiling, but for now, enjoy the water!",
    "project_2_title": "Virtual Dive Simulator",
    "project_2_description": "Virtual reality provides an escape from everyday life. It allows users to experience an artificial environment that they may otherwise never see. VR is not just used for entertainment; it has very real practical and educational applications. This project seeks to use virtual reality to teach users some of the basics of scuba diving. By reducing the barrier to entry, it will make diving more accessible, and hopefully spread interest in it. The final artifact is a scuba diving simulator that will show how applicable VR is as a teaching method.\n\nThis scuba diving simulator uses aspects from real diving courses to make it more realistic. It uses virtual gauges based off real dive instruments and encourages the users to learn their functionality through trial and error. Teaching a subject through virtual reality makes it more like a game. This change of point of view can help users engage with the teaching and absorb more information.\n\nParticipants in the simulator’s user study agreed that this simulator would encourage environmental awareness despite not having a large focus on the topic. By getting more people interested in diving, the simulator could help to spread involvement in ocean conservation. Most participants were able to learn more about the subject and found the experience immersive and informative. The project provides a great basis for expansion into other aspects of diving or even different subjects. It could also be integrated with various dive courses to help improve and streamline the learning process.",
