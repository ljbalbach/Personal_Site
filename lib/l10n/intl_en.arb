    "about_description": "I am someone who likes to be curious – take a new course, learn a new sport, play a new instrument. For some reason it doesn’t stop there; it needs to be as weird as possible. If I have heard of something, or know someone else has it, I become uninterested. From the purple jackets I wear, to the songs I listen to, to the software I like to make; It all needs to be exciting, unique, and done the right way, otherwise why bother. I am an avid pianist, traveler, kiteboarder, SCUBA diver, backcountry alpine skier, mountain climber, and anything else I can get my hands on. I speak Spanish for the most part – mainly to find new food to try. I love new things, but still somehow love coming back to my routine, my home, my friends, and my family.\n\nI don’t believe that my intelligence or talent have been instrumental bringing me to where I am today. For me, it’s my curiosity that compels me to push forward. While I may have the ability to do the research and write a thorough paper on Stalinism, my curiosity implores me to do something a bit more captivating. No offence meant toward anyone who has spent their life on Stalinism, but personally, I would rather rake cut grass into three perfect piles. In recent time, software engineers are no longer scarce, but anyone can build a website. My need for an answer forces me to be more inventive and have more fun. Given the time, curiosity will create something far more interesting than raw skill (not that I’m completely lacking in that area). This page is the perfect example of my point. While yes, I could have made the same personal site that everyone does, I find that boring and uninteresting. Quite frankly, I don’t think I could even finish one – I would probably end up fading away into something a bit more exciting, like lunch.",
